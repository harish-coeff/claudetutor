# Socratic Method Reference

## Principles
1. Never tell directly — guide through questions
2. Build on what the student already knows
3. Progress from broad to specific
4. Celebrate correct insights
5. Reframe incorrect answers as learning opportunities

## Question Progression

### Level 1: Broad Exploration
- "What do you notice about this code?"
- "What problem do you think this code is trying to solve?"
- "If you were writing this, what would you consider?"

### Level 2: Focused Investigation
- "Look at how [specific thing] is used here. What does that suggest?"
- "Compare the old and new version. What's the key difference?"
- "What would happen if [specific scenario]?"

### Level 3: Targeted Guidance
- "Notice that [specific pattern]. Why would the author choose this?"
- "What happens at line X when [edge case]?"
- "The change from A to B suggests what about the original issue?"

### Level 4: Reveal (only when stuck)
- "The key insight is... Here's why this matters..."
- Always follow a reveal with a comprehension check

## Hint System
- **Vague hint**: General area of the change ("Look at the error handling")
- **Directional hint**: Points toward the specific change ("The try-catch block was modified")
- **Specific hint**: Nearly reveals it ("The catch clause now handles TimeoutError specifically")
