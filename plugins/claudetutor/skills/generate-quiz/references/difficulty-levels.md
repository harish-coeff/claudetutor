# Difficulty Levels Reference

## Level 1: Recognition
- Identify what a code construct does
- Match syntax to concepts
- Example: "What does `Array.map()` return?"

## Level 2: Understanding
- Explain what a specific piece of code does
- Predict output for simple inputs
- Example: "What does this function return when called with [1, 2, 3]?"

## Level 3: Application
- Understand why code was written this way
- Identify the design decision behind a change
- Example: "Why was this refactored from a class to a hook?"

## Level 4: Analysis
- Predict edge cases and failure modes
- Identify potential bugs or performance issues
- Example: "What happens if the API call fails during the state update?"

## Level 5: Synthesis
- Design alternative approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs between implementations
- Example: "How would you implement this differently? What are the trade-offs?"
